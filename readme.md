#Catalogue

###Ideas
- Upon visiting you are asked to provide your SoundCloud, YouTube and any other publicly accessible music storage account usernames.
- We then grab all of their liked songs and playlists and provide an application to access them all from in one place.
- We may ask them to provide more metadata for each song added. We can then use this to catalogue their library efficiently.

###Stack
- Use NodeJS with Express for backend framework.
- Use MongoDB for database querying.
- Use Angular for data binding the results returned from the database to the view. Directives can be use to split components of the interface.
